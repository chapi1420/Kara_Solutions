# Ethiopian Medical Businesses Data Warehouse Project

## Overview

This project involves building a data warehouse to store data on Ethiopian medical businesses scraped from Telegram channels. The goal is to create a robust, scalable system that facilitates comprehensive data analysis, enabling better decision-making based on insights derived from the data.

### Business Need

As a data engineer at Kara Solutions, this project aims to address the challenges of collecting and analyzing data from various sources, particularly Telegram channels. The implementation of ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) frameworks will ensure data integrity and usability.

## Learning Outcomes

### Skills
- Telegram scraping using Beautiful Soup, Scrapy, and Selenium
- Object detection using YOLO (You Only Look Once)
- Data cleaning and transformation using ETL processes
- Database schema design for data warehouses
- Implementing and configuring relational DBMS (e.g., PostgreSQL)
- Data integration and enrichment techniques
- End-to-end data pipeline development
- Testing and validation of data systems
- Deployment and maintenance of data warehouses

### Knowledge
- Identifying relevant data sources for Ethiopian medical businesses
- Principles of object detection and its applications
- Best practices in data cleaning and preprocessing
- Structuring data for efficient storage and retrieval in data warehouses
- Techniques for integrating and enriching data from multiple sources
- Implementing robust security measures for data protection

## Project Structure

The project is divided into four main tasks:

1. **Data Scraping and Collection Pipeline**
   - Utilize the Telegram API or custom scripts to extract data.
   - Store raw data in a temporary storage location.
   - Implement logging to track the scraping process.

2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**
   - Remove duplicates, handle missing values, and standardize formats.
   - Use DBT (Data Build Tool) for data transformation.

3. **Object Detection Using YOLO**
   - Set up the environment with necessary dependencies.
   - Collect images and use a pre-trained YOLO model for object detection.
   - Store detection results in a database.

4. **Expose Collected Data Using FastAPI**
   - Create a FastAPI application to serve the collected data.
   - Implement CRUD operations and define API endpoints.

## Installation
